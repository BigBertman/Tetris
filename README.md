# Tetris
Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Alexey Pajitnov in the Soviet Union.

Originally released on June 6, 1984, for the Electronika 60, Tetris involved falling tetrominoes that must be manipulated to form complete lines, which are then cleared from the grid.
