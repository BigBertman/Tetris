# Tetris
//Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Alexey Pajitnov in the Soviet Union. //
Originally released on June 6, 1984, for the Electronika 60, Tetris involved falling tetrominoes that must be manipulated to form complete lines, which are then cleared from the grid.
